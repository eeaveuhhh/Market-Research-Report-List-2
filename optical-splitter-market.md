<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Splitter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fused Biconic Tapered Splitters</li><li>Planar Lightwave Circuit Splitters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical splitters are devices used in fiber optic networks to split an incoming optical signal into multiple output signals. Fused Biconic Tapered Splitters are based on two fiber optic fibers that are fused together and tapered to split the signal. Planar Lightwave Circuit Splitters use an integrated optical waveguide chip to split the signal. Fused Biconic Tapered Splitters are more cost-effective for smaller-scale applications, while Planar Lightwave Circuit Splitters offer higher performance and are more suitable for larger networks.</p></p>
