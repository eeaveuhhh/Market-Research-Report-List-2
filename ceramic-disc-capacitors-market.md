<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ceramic Disc Capacitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight Leads Type</li><li>Crimped Leads Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ceramic disc capacitors are available in two main types based on their lead configurations - straight leads type and crimped leads type. Straight leads type capacitors have leads that come directly out of the body of the capacitor in a straight line, making them easy to solder onto circuit boards. On the other hand, crimped leads type capacitors have leads that are bent at an angle and crimped to provide a secure connection. Both types are commonly used in electronic devices and have their own advantages depending on the application.</p></p>
