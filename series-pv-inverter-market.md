<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Series PV Inverter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-phase</li><li>Three-phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Series PV inverters are divided into two main types: single-phase and three-phase. Single-phase inverters are typically used in residential applications, where the PV system is smaller and only requires power conversion for single-phase AC loads. Three-phase inverters, on the other hand, are used in commercial and utility-scale installations, where the PV system is larger and requires power conversion for three-phase AC loads. Both types of inverters play a critical role in converting DC power generated by solar panels into usable AC power for electrical appliances.</p></p>
