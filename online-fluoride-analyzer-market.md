<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Online Fluoride Analyzer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reagentless</li><li>Reagent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Online Fluoride Analyzer is available in two main types - Reagentless and Reagent-based. Reagentless analyzers do not require the use of chemical reagents for fluoride detection, making them ideal for continuous monitoring applications. On the other hand, Reagent-based analyzers utilize chemical reagents to facilitate the detection of fluoride ions in water samples. Both types of analyzers provide accurate and reliable results, with reagentless analyzers being more cost-effective in the long run due to the elimination of reagent costs.</p></p>
