<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transient Voltage Suppressor Diodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uni-polar TVS Diodes</li><li>Bi-polar TVS Diodes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Transient Voltage Suppressor Diodes, commonly known as TVS diodes, are used to protect electronic devices from voltage spikes and surges. There are two main types of TVS diodes: Uni-polar TVS diodes, which are designed to protect against positive voltage transients, and Bi-polar TVS diodes, which protect against both positive and negative voltage transients. Uni-polar TVS diodes are typically used in applications where only one polarity of protection is needed, while Bi-polar TVS diodes are used in applications requiring protection against both polarities of voltage transients.</p></p>
