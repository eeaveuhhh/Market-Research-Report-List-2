<p><h1>Sandwich ELISA Market Insights, Market Players and Forecast Till 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Sandwich ELISA Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Sandwich ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) is a highly sensitive technique used to detect and quantify specific proteins in a sample. This assay involves capturing the target protein between two antibodies – one coated on a solid phase (such as a microplate) and the other conjugated to an enzyme. The enzyme-substrate reaction produces a measurable signal, which is proportional to the concentration of the target protein.</p><p>The Sandwich ELISA Market is experiencing steady growth, with an expected CAGR of 3.80% during the forecast period. The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, such as cancer, infectious diseases, and autoimmune disorders, is driving the demand for accurate and reliable diagnostic tools like Sandwich ELISA. Additionally, technological advancements in the field of immunoassays, rising R&D investments by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and the growing focus on personalized medicine are further fueling market growth.</p><p>On the other hand, the high cost of Sandwich ELISA kits, stringent regulatory requirements, and the availability of alternative diagnostic technologies may hinder market expansion. However, the development of automated and multiplexed ELISA systems, along with the increasing adoption of point-of-care testing, are anticipated to create lucrative opportunities for market players in the coming years.</p></p>
